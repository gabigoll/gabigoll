# Hi there, I'm gabigoll 👋

I'm currently an apprentice IT Specialist, specializing in platform development. While my main background is in networking, you'll often find me building websites and projects right here on GitHub.

## 🚀 Current Focus

- **cybdef:** My favorite project right now! I'm developing a cyber defense platform designed to make cybersecurity accessible for everyone. Stay tuned for updates.

## 🛠️ Skills & Interests

- **Networking:** My foundational expertise.
- **Web Development:** Passionate about creating web platforms and tools.
- **Cybersecurity:** Motivated to continuously grow and deepen my skills in this field.
- **Surfing:** When I'm not coding, I'm probably catching some waves!

## 🌱 What's Next?

After cybdef, I'll be working on **wealthence**—a platform to help people grow their wealth and gain valuable financial insights.

I'm always eager to learn more, tackle new challenges, and connect with others interested in tech, cyber defense, and building something meaningful.

Thanks for stopping by! 🚀
