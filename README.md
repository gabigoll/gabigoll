# Hi there, I'm gabigoll 👋

I'm currently an apprentice IT Specialist, specializing in **platform development**. My core background lies in **IT infrastructure**, where I work extensively with **server environments**, **networking**, and **Microsoft technologies**.

While I'm deeply involved in configuring and managing modern IT environments, I also have a strong passion for building websites and digital platforms — many of which you'll find right here on GitHub.

## 🚀 Current Focus

- **cybdef:** My favorite project right now! I'm developing a cybersecurity platform that aims to make cyber defense knowledge accessible to everyone. Stay tuned for updates.

## 🛠️ Skills & Interests

- **IT Infrastructure & Networking:** Working with Windows Server, Linux environments, Active Directory, firewalls, and complex network setups.
- **Microsoft Ecosystem:** Hands-on experience with Microsoft 365, Intune, Azure AD, Endpoint Management, and other enterprise tools.
- **Web Development:** Passionate about crafting secure and modern websites using cutting-edge technologies.
- **Cybersecurity:** Continuously expanding my expertise in the areas of digital security and threat protection.
- **Surfing:** When I'm not building or configuring systems, I'm probably out catching waves! 🏄

## 🌱 What's Next?

After CybDef, I'll be launching **Wealthence** — a platform designed to help people grow their wealth and gain valuable financial knowledge.

I'm always eager to learn more, solve challenging problems, and connect with like-minded people in tech, cybersecurity, and infrastructure engineering.

Thanks for stopping by! 🚀
